# Arcipelago
A moderated event platform for Telegram.

## How it works
This software powers a virtual event wall on Telegram.
Through the Telegram bot, users can propose events to a group of admins who can accept or reject publication.
Events are published on a public channel, where subscribed users also receive reminders about daily events.
Optionally, events can be published on a shared Google Calendar.

## Setup

Follow these steps if you want to run a new instance of the bot.
In order to run the instance, you will need to create a new bot via [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather), as well as a channel (i.e., the public event wall) and a group for admins.
You will need to add the bot token and the chat IDs for the public channel and the admin group in the config file.

Currently, the installation process has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.3 LTS.
